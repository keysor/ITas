# Major
I've had a tough time choosing my major throughout my years of education. All throughout highschool I had no idea what I wanted to do, even now as a sophmore in college im not too sure what I would like to do, however take a journey with me.
1. **Chemical Engineering**

    When I first got into college I had enjoyed highscool chemistry so much I had thought I wanted to head down a chemical engineering road, clearly I was wrong! I shortly swapped to Physics.

2. **Physics**

    I wasn't too sure what I wanted to do with physics but I can tell you I had just as much fun in AP physics as I did in AP chemistry however I thought physics would be more applicable, again I proved myself wrong when I found Computer science / IT
  
3. **Computer Science**

    I kinda just started down this road as well as IT at the same time but I think I'm going to stop going down the computer science road and head towards IT.
 
 4. **IT**
  
  The bread to my butter, I have grown up around computers since I was 8 and built one with my father, it seemed natural to involve this into my career path so I think this is my final destination.
